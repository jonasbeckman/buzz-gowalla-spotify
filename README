This application is pulling out Gowalla posts from Google Buzz that are made within 100m from the
Spotify HQ in Stockholm (but could easily be made to support any location). We then find the
latest Spotify URIs from those users and print them out.

The Python API limits we've hit while making this were:
* Unable to search for posts by user ID.
* Search results does not contained 'published' or 'updated' dates.
